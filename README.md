# vim-scholar
Vim plugin for importing BibTeX data directly from Google Scholar

Uses [https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py](https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py) for retrieving the data.

The plugin is just a very crude vim layer on top of that.

## Usage
Requires `+python3`.
It maps `<Leader>gs` to the "wizard" asking for author(s) and title.

## Questions/contributions
Suggestions of improvements are very welcome!
The plugin was written as a hack to fulfill my needs.
The style and code are therefore note elegant, but I am happy to make changes upon request.
